Click on a clipping to read the original paper in the <i><a href=\"http://newsprint.dailycal.org/\">The Daily Californian</a> </i> archives.\n\nThe x- and y-axes of the following graph denote years and median rent prices, respectively. The <span style=\"color:#c06014\">orange</span> line denotes median rent without taking inflation into consideration, while the <span style=\"color:#6199e2\">blue</span> line denotes median rent adjusted to inflation, using 1978 as the base year.","panel_ww2":"During World War II, rent controls, imposed by the federal government, are applied in Berkeley for the first time. They expire in August 1951, after a resolution stating that rental shortages no longer exist.","panel_1971":"President Nixon institutes temporary national wage and price controls, which include a freeze on rent increases","panel_1972":"The Rent Control Charter Amendment, an initiative measure to continue the rent freeze, is placed on the ballot and passes.","panel_1973_jan":"The price controls instituted by the federal government end.","panel_1973_may":"In <i> Birkenfeld v. the City of Berkeley</i>, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Robert Bostick rules the Rent Control Charter Amendment as unconstitutional.","panel_1976":"The California Supreme Court, which agrees to take the case, unanimously overturns the 1972 rent control measure but supports the legality of local rent control.","panel_1978_june":"California voters pass Proposition 13, an initiative measure that amends the state constitution to reduce property taxes and limit future property tax increases.","panel_1978_nov":"Berkeley voters pass the Renter Property Tax Relief Ordinance, which temporarily reduces rents to provide renters a property tax rebate. The ordinance is “self-enforcing”, meaning that tenants are expected to enforce it if it is violated by a landlord. This leads to widespread non-compliance.","panel_1980_left_a":"Berkeley voters pass the Rent Stabilization and Eviction for Good Cause Ordinance (now <a href=\"https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/Berkeley/?Berkeley13/Berkeley1376/Berkeley1376.html&?f\">Berkeley Municipal Code Chapter 13.76</a>), the basic framework of Berkeley rent control. A base rent is established as the lawful rent.

Berkeley joins the housing crisis emerging in the Bay Area.","panel_1995":"The <a href=\"https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/California_Civil_Code__Sec_1954_50-1954_535_(Costa-Hawkins).aspx\">Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act</a> prevents rent control from covering any property built after the law passed and mandates “vacancy decontrol”, which allows landlords to raise rents to market rate after a tenant moves out of a rent-controlled unit. It is essentially a statewide-rent control restriction.","panel_2018":"Proposition 10 fails to pass; Costa Hawkins is not repealed.
